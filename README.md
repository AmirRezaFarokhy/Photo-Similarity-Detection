# Photo-Similarity-Detection
Making wall clock photos and using them to match with new photos.

## Implementation guide
1. First you need to create fake wall clocks image, so run this python code `Create_Clock_dataset.py`.
2. Finally, you need to run `main.py` to check all the images you created and find the maximum similarity with the real image.

### Resjult
Result images are available in `check_tests_image.ipynb` jupyter notebook.
